# hello-world
The first Github Repository of mine

This ID is called RickyLili. Ricky is the origin of my Chinese name( my mom is a big fan of Ricky Martin that time), so I just pick it as my English name.

What about Lili? I just doubled my family name and got it as my nickname.

Lili seems like a girl's name. Yea, in my high school age, I was mental girl.
